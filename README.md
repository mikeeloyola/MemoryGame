**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Mikee Loyola**

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wiggly-boulder-farmhouse)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[As this was my first ever experience using the HTML computing language and the github/glitch websites, one challenge that I encounterd when creating this submision was that
there was definitly a slight learning curb in the beginning. In particular to HTML, I did not know that you can add attributes to the code as opposed to what I am used to in
other programming languages. However, it was enlightening to learn that HTML uses button elements and I will take this information with me moving forward. From the courses I 
have taken thus far, we mainly focused on the code's functionality vs. display. I was able to overcome these obstacles through lots and lots of trial and error. Thankfully, the
instructions for the prework were very detailed and offered visual examples of the code which helped me answer any questions I had througout the entire process.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission, the questions that I had about web development was what determined certain fonts to be classified as "web-safe", and how does web development evolve with
the changing expectations of what a "good" website is supposed to look like. What is deemed "aesthetically pleasing" is an imagery that is constantly progressing to new norms. How do
web developers keep up with this phenomenon? Will I be able to accomplish this?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend more time customizing the style of the webpage and making it more like something people would want to search up to play.
I actually already changed the background color from slategrey to a hex color (#3947d99) of my own choice, but I wanted to spend more time making the button colors match the color palette
I had in mind that will be complementary to the mauve color I chose for the background instead of just light green, light blue, pink, and light yellow.]
